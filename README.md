## Usage

In your `WORKSPACE` file load and include as follows:

```
# Make the rule "http_archive" available.
load("@bazel_tools//tools/build_defs/repo:http.bzl", "http_archive")

BAZEL_BATS_VERSION = "0.29.1"

# Make the external repo "bazel_bats" available.
http_archive(
    name = "bazel_bats",
    strip_prefix = "bazel-bats-%s" % BAZEL_BATS_VERSION,
    urls = [
        "https://github.com/filmil/bazel-bats/archive/refs/tags/v%s.tar.gz" % BAZEL_BATS_VERSION,
    ],
    sha256 = "94aea504205cee5f00d9182975a95a5dadf1747fecb75f7d93e09cccc1c19803",
)

# Load the function "bazel_bats_dependencide"
load("@bazel_bats//:deps.bzl", "bazel_bats_dependencies")

# 'version' and 'sha256' of bats-core can be provided to override the version of v1.1.0.
bazel_bats_dependencies()
```

In your `BUILD.bazel` file add the following:

```
load("@bazel_bats//:rules.bzl", "bats_test")

bats_test(
  name = "hello_world_test",
  srcs = ["hello_world.bats"],
)
```

## Examples

This repository is an example of a repo with BATS tests.  If you have `bazel`
installed, you can try it out as follows:

```console
git clone https://github.com/filmil/bazel-bats.git
cd bazel-bats
bazel test //...
```

Feel free to take a look at the `WORKSPACE` file to see how your workspace file
should look like and at `tests/BUILD.bazel` to see a sample build file.

To run the integration tests, change to the `integration/` directory and run,

```console
cd integration
bazel test //...
```
